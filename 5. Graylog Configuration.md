# Inputs
Let's take a look at the different types of inputs. The key ones I'm going to set up are syslog (both tcp and udp) and beats inputs, but they have quite a few others.

You can also check out their marketplace which is a little hit and miss but does have some nice content packs that include additional inputs and dashboards.

We'll use authbind to allow inputs to listen to ports lower than 1024.

``sudo apt-get install -y authbind``

``nano /etc/default/graylog-server``

> Add GRAYLOG_COMMAND_WRAPPER="authbind"

``sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/514``<br>
``sudo chown graylog:graylog /etc/authbind/byport/514``<br>
``sudo chmod 755 /etc/authbind/byport/514``<br>
``sudo touch '/etc/authbind/byport/!514'``<br>
``sudo chown graylog:graylog '/etc/authbind/byport/!514'``<br>
``sudo chmod 755 '/etc/authbind/byport/!514'``

``sudo systemctl restart graylog-server``

# Indices and Streams
You can create indices to change retention of events as well as replacte the events across clusters differently. This allows you to keep some logs for 180 days while only keeping others for 30 days.

When combined with Streams, we can control who has access to what events. This allows us to create a networking index that the networking team can view without having access to the server logs.

# Pipelines
Graylog has an incredibly powerful processing engine called pipelines. This allows you to normalize, transform, enrich, etc. the data coming in as well as define where the data goes.

Both streams and pipelines can use regex to extract values from messages that were not properly extracted. I tend to prefer using streams, but Graylog is trying to move everything into pipelines.

# Authentication
Graylog supports both Active Directory and LDAP. I'm having some weird issues with my lab... They have also been making adjustments to the way groups are done, and a lot has changed in 4.x.

# Alerts
Graylog has the ability to alert when it detects an event or a time/count based event (such as the use of whoami or 15 failed logon events within 15 seconds).

If we have time, we can step through setting up an alert as getting the fields you want to come through in the email can be tricky.

# Dashboards
Dashboards allow us to build a set of queries to create nice visualizations. We can then drill into those visualizations to see the data underneath them.

Good examples that I had built were around authentication (failed attempts, locked accounts, failed password changes, etc.).
