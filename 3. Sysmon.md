# Introduction
Microsoft's Sysinternals Sysmon is a service and driver that collects information from low level providers in Windows and outputs that information into the Sysmon event log.

You can download Sysmon here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon

Sysmon correlates the data you would normally have to search through dozens of event logs to find and delivers it in a very clean, useful event.

The other unique thing about Sysmon is that it can use rules to include or exclude events so that you can tune it for your environment.

# Configurations
There are a couple of popular base configurations - [SwiftOnSecurity](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config) and [Olaf Hartong's Modular Config](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular)

I prefer working with Olaf's configuration because I find it easier to read and maintain. It is also kept more up-to-date and maps a lot of techniques back to the Mitre ATT&CK Framewarok

# Installation
Installation is quite simple, but you want to make sure that you include a configuration with it. The command line will look like this:

``Sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml -accepteula``

Updating the configuration file can be as simple as:

``C:\Windows\System32\Sysmon64.exe -c "\\path\to\sysmonconfig.xml"``

Upgrades are complicated because it is a driver that is loaded. This means you will have to uninstall and then install the new version, and sometimes the uninstall will hang up requiring a reboot to fully unload.

For this demo, we're going to download the pre-compiled sysmonconfig.xml from Olaf.
