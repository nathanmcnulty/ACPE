# Windows Logging

Windows auditing out of the box is missing a lot of useful information. Here are a few resources that will be helpful in determining what to enable:

## Advanced Auditing

[Malware Archeology Cheat Sheets](https://www.malwarearchaeology.com/cheat-sheets)

[Palantir Recommendations](https://github.com/palantir/windows-event-forwarding/tree/master/group-policy-objects)

[Log-MD](https://www.imfsecurity.com/free)

[Defender for Identity Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/configure-windows-event-collection#configure-audit-policies)

[NSA Guidance](https://github.com/nsacyber/Event-Forwarding-Guidance/tree/master/Events)

It's important to know where these are and how to enable them, but to make sure we can finish, we're going to focus on Sysmon and come back to this if we can.

## Event collection

Graylog Sidecar is an agent you can install that includes both the logging agents as well as the ability to update the configuration from the Graylog server.

If you do not want to deploy this software to all of your servers/endpoints, you can use Windows Event Collectors and Windows Event Forwarding to have clients send their event logs to one or more collector servers.

From here, you could have an agent that sends the logs to Graylog. This adds complexity but gives you flexibility to use something like [LogBinder SuperCharger](https://www.logbinder.com/Products/Supercharger/) to do some pre-processing and reduce resource usage on Graylog.
