# Graylog Sidecar

## Introduction

The Graylog Sidecar comes with two logging agents - winlogbeat and filebeat. It can also control nxlog if you would prefer to use that.

We can also add other beats like auditbeat to a host and add a config to the sidecar.

The documenation for the sidecar can be found here: <https://docs.graylog.org/en/4.0/pages/sidecar.html>

## Installation

Unfortunately, Graylog is not signing their binaries when compiling, so their sidecar is currently being flagged as possibly malicious...

You can download the sidecar from here:
<https://github.com/Graylog2/collector-sidecar>

The installation does support some silent install flags where you can pass it the API key and nodename:

````cmd
graylog_sidecar_installer_1.1.0-1.exe /S -SERVERURL=https://graylog.kindofsecure.com/api -APITOKEN=8130a0nt4pm3qjvietkuqoingveud5c0cecu19of516v2gdsc2l

"C:\Program Files\graylog\sidecar\graylog-sidecar.exe" -service install

"C:\Program Files\graylog\sidecar\graylog-sidecar.exe" -service start
````

## Configuration

Let's take a moment to walk through customizing the beats config.

If we have time, I'd like to go over adding auditbeats as well.
